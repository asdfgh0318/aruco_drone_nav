# ArUco Marker Map Configuration
# Maps ArUco marker IDs to their world coordinates (ceiling positions)
#
# Coordinate system (ENU):
#   X: East (positive)
#   Y: North (positive)
#   Z: Up (positive) - ceiling height
#
# Origin (0, 0, 0) is on the floor at the starting/takeoff position

# World origin definition
origin:
  description: "Takeoff position on the floor"
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0

# Ceiling height
ceiling_height: 3.0

# ArUco markers (DICT_4X4_50, printed on A4 at 18cm)
# Generate with: python tools/generate_markers.py --ids 0,1,2,3 --dictionary DICT_4X4_50 --size 18
markers:
  # Primary marker - directly above origin
  - id: 0
    position: [0.0, 0.0, 3.0]
    orientation: 0
    description: "Origin marker - above takeoff"

  # Additional markers (uncomment and adjust positions as needed)
  # - id: 1
  #   position: [2.0, 0.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "East marker"

  # - id: 2
  #   position: [0.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "North marker"

  # - id: 3
  #   position: [2.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "Northeast marker"

# Marker placement guidelines:
# - Print markers at 100% scale (18cm x 18cm on A4)
# - Mount flat on ceiling, facing straight down
# - Ensure good lighting and contrast (white border helps)
# - Measure positions from the defined origin
# - Multiple markers provide redundancy and coverage
