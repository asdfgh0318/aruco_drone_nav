# ArUco Marker Map Configuration
# Maps marker IDs to their world coordinates (ceiling positions)
#
# Coordinate system:
#   X: East (positive)
#   Y: North (positive)
#   Z: Up (positive) - this is the ceiling height
#
# Origin (0, 0, 0) is typically on the floor at the starting position

# World origin definition (for reference)
origin:
  description: "Starting position on the floor"
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0

# Ceiling height (approximate, markers have individual Z values)
ceiling_height: 3.0

# Marker definitions
markers:
  # Example: Single marker for Phase 1 testing
  - id: 0
    position: [0.0, 0.0, 3.0]      # Directly above origin
    orientation: 0                  # Marker rotation (degrees, clockwise from North)
    description: "Origin marker - starting position"

  # Additional markers for Phase 2 (uncomment and configure as needed)
  # - id: 1
  #   position: [2.0, 0.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "East corridor marker"

  # - id: 2
  #   position: [2.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "Northeast corner marker"

  # - id: 3
  #   position: [0.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "North corridor marker"

  # - id: 4
  #   position: [1.0, 1.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "Center marker"

# Marker placement guidelines:
# - Ensure markers overlap in coverage (drone can see multiple)
# - Place markers 1-2 meters apart for redundancy
# - All markers should be flat on ceiling, facing down
# - Measure positions accurately from the defined origin
