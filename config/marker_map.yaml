# ArUco Diamond Marker Map Configuration
# Maps diamond marker IDs to their world coordinates (ceiling positions)
#
# Coordinate system:
#   X: East (positive)
#   Y: North (positive)
#   Z: Up (positive) - this is the ceiling height
#
# Origin (0, 0, 0) is typically on the floor at the starting position
#
# Diamond ID format: "id0_id1_id2_id3" where ids are the 4 ArUco marker IDs
# Diamond structure:
#        [id0]
#     [id3]  [id1]
#        [id2]

# World origin definition (for reference)
origin:
  description: "Starting position on the floor"
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0

# Ceiling height (approximate, markers have individual Z values)
ceiling_height: 3.0

# Diamond marker definitions
diamonds:
  # Primary diamond marker for initial testing
  - id: "0_1_2_3"
    position: [0.0, 0.0, 3.0]      # Directly above origin
    orientation: 0                  # Marker rotation (degrees, clockwise from North)
    description: "Origin diamond - starting position"

  # Additional diamond markers (uncomment and configure as needed)
  # - id: "4_5_6_7"
  #   position: [2.0, 0.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "East corridor diamond"

  # - id: "8_9_10_11"
  #   position: [2.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "Northeast corner diamond"

  # - id: "12_13_14_15"
  #   position: [0.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  #   orientation: 0
  #   description: "North corridor diamond"

# Diamond marker placement guidelines:
# - Ensure markers overlap in coverage (drone can see multiple)
# - Place markers 1-2 meters apart for redundancy
# - All markers should be flat on ceiling, facing down
# - Measure positions accurately from the defined origin
# - Each diamond uses 4 unique ArUco IDs (from DICT_4X4_50)
# - Recommended: ID0=0_1_2_3, ID1=4_5_6_7, ID2=8_9_10_11, etc.
